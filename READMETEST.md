Here's how to adapt those instructions for SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), which is used for Microsoft SQL Server databases:

Prerequisites
Microsoft SQL Server Database Engine: You need an instance of SQL Server installed and running (e.g., SQL Server Express, Developer Edition, or a full version).

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): This is the client tool you'll use to connect to and manage your SQL Server instance.

Steps
Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):

Launch SSMS from your Start Menu.

When the "Connect to Server" dialog appears, enter your server name (e.g., . for a local default instance, (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB for SQL Server Express LocalDB, or YOUR_SERVER_NAME\SQLEXPRESS if you named your instance).

Choose your authentication method (usually "Windows Authentication" for local development or "SQL Server Authentication" if you have a specific username and password).

Click "Connect."

Create the Database:

In the Object Explorer (usually on the left), right-click on "Databases" and select "New Database...".

In the "New Database" dialog, enter university_db as the Database name.

Click "OK."

Alternatively, you can open a New Query window (File > New > Query with Current Connection or Ctrl+N) and execute the following:

SQL

CREATE DATABASE university_db;
GO
USE university_db;
GO
Note: GO is a batch terminator specific to SQL Server and is important for separating commands.

Create Tables (Execute db_schema.sql):

In SSMS, go to File > Open > File...

Navigate to the location of your db_schema.sql file, select it, and click "Open."

The script will open in a new query window.

Make sure university_db is selected in the database dropdown menu (usually near the "Execute" button in the toolbar). If not, you can add USE university_db; at the top of your db_schema.sql file, or simply select it from the dropdown.

Click the "Execute" button (or press F5) to run the script. This will create your Students, Courses, and Enrollments tables.

Insert Sample Data (Execute sample_data.sql):

Follow the same process as in step 3:

Go to File > Open > File...

Navigate to your sample_data.sql file, select it, and click "Open."

Ensure university_db is selected in the database dropdown.

Click "Execute" (or F5) to populate your tables with example records.

Run Analysis Queries (Execute analysis_queries.sql):

Again, open the analysis_queries.sql file in SSMS (File > Open > File...).

Ensure university_db is selected in the database dropdown.

You can execute the queries one by one by highlighting a single query and clicking "Execute" (F5), or execute the entire file at once to see all results.

Analysis Examples (from analysis_queries.sql)
The analysis_queries.sql file will contain standard SQL queries that should work largely as-is in SQL Server. Examples of what you'll find and execute:

Total Number of Students and Courses:

SQL

SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalStudents FROM Students;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalCourses FROM Courses;
Courses with Most Enrollments:

SQL

SELECT C.CourseName, COUNT(E.EnrollmentID) AS NumberOfEnrollments
FROM Courses C
JOIN Enrollments E ON C.CourseID = E.CourseID
GROUP BY C.CourseName
ORDER BY NumberOfEnrollments DESC;
Students and Their Enrolled Courses:

SQL

SELECT S.FirstName, S.LastName, C.CourseName
FROM Students S
JOIN Enrollments E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID
JOIN Courses C ON E.CourseID = C.CourseID
ORDER BY S.LastName, S.FirstName, C.CourseName;
Students Not Enrolled in Any Course:

SQL

SELECT S.FirstName, S.LastName
FROM Students S
LEFT JOIN Enrollments E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID
WHERE E.EnrollmentID IS NULL;
Enrollment Count Per Department:

SQL

-- This assumes your Courses table has a 'Department' column.
-- If not, adjust db_schema.sql to include it, or create a similar grouping.
SELECT C.Department, COUNT(E.EnrollmentID) AS TotalEnrollments
FROM Courses C
JOIN Enrollments E ON C.CourseID = E.CourseID
GROUP BY C.Department
ORDER BY TotalEnrollments DESC;
Average Credits Enrolled Per Student:

SQL

-- This assumes your Courses table has a 'Credits' column.
SELECT S.FirstName, S.LastName, AVG(C.Credits) AS AverageCredits
FROM Students S
JOIN Enrollments E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID
JOIN Courses C ON E.CourseID = C.CourseID
GROUP BY S.FirstName, S.LastName
ORDER BY S.LastName, S.FirstName;
This adaptation provides specific instructions and considerations for using SSMS with Microsoft SQL Server, making it directly applicable to your environment.
